# AI-Assignment2
## Algorithms Implemented

- **Branch and Bound (BnB)**
- **Iterative Deepening A\* (IDA\*)**


Both algorithms find an optimal path from the start to the goal on a grid-based frozen lake, and generate a GIF to visualize the navigation.

# Steps to run :
- **Clone the repo**
- **Setup the Virtual Environments**
- **Install the Dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt**
- **Run the code using python main.py**
- **You get the choise of chosing the algorithm you want to use so give the propmpt and then check the output**

# Output
- **Path chosen**
- **Number of steps taken**
- **Timme taken**
- **A newly created file in the results folder whuch contain the gifs**

# Notes:
- **Environment: FrozenLake-v1, 4x4 grid, non-slippery**
- **Cost: Uniform cost (1 per move)**
- **Goal: Bottom-right cell**
- **Heuristic (IDA\*): Manhattan Distance**
